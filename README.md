# Kanban

A front-end Kanban drag & drop interface.  There are some example cards, columns and boards.  Try to edit, move or
 delete them and see what will happen.  Certainly, you can also create your own cards, columns and boards.  Have fun : )

This is the draft version for the real project. It meets the main functionalities, but has no CSS design and
 implementation in details.

## Installation

Run `npm install` .

## Running

Run `npm start`.

## Existing bug

Sometimes the drag & drop can't work smoothly.  In this case, `Ctrl + C` to stop the current project. Switch to branch
 **dragular** and start it, then switch back to **Kanban** branch directly.
